# Improving Travel Itinerary Planning: A K-Means Clustering-Based System with a User-Generated Experience Module (IN LONDON)

## Overview
This project is a personalized itinerary planner for travelers visiting London. The goal is to help users plan their trip efficiently by creating a customized itinerary based on their preferences. The system uses K-Means clustering to generate personalized itineraries and allows users to share their travel experiences through blogs and vlogs.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
- **Personalized Itinerary Generation**: Based on the user's preferences (e.g., nature, nightlife, art), the system uses K-Means clustering to generate a customized travel itinerary.
- **User-Generated Content**: Users can upload travel blogs (text) and vlogs (video links) to share their experiences.
- **Itinerary Customization**: Users can edit, save, and view past itineraries.
- **Interactive Map**: Travel itineraries are visualized on an interactive map using Folium.
- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Users can rate and review places they’ve visited, helping others decide on their plans.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering for itinerary generation)
- **Visualization**: Folium (for interactive maps)
- **Password Security**: Flask-Bcrypt (for securely hashing user passwords)
## User Interaction
**Sign Up and Log In**:
New users can register using their email and password.
Registered users can log in and manage their profiles.

**Planning a Trip**:
Users fill out a form specifying their trip details (e.g., preferred activities, travel dates).
The system generates an itinerary based on their preferences.

**Viewing and Customizing Itinerary**:
Users can view, modify, and save their itineraries.
They can also drag and drop activities on the itinerary for better customization.

**Uploading Travel Content**:
Users can upload travel blogs (text) and vlogs (video links) to share with others.
They can view other users’ content and interact through likes and comments.
